# ColourSorter
This is a simple visualizer for sorting algorithms in C#. Values in lists are represented by colours. First, all lists get shuffled. Then we can choose an algorithm and watch the lists getting sorted.

Currently implemented:

 - Bubble Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Merge Sort
 - Stooge Sort
